Helps to rename tons of files in a directory at once using a common base name and then appending the a number in a sequential manner after the common base name. This code is intelligent enough and it will skip a file if its already named
in the intendent manner and will make sure that the remaining files are renamed with different name hence ensuring no data is overwritten.
Moreover, This code will create a CSV file with the name demo.csv where it will contain both the new file name and its corresponding old file name.
